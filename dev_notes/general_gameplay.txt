PROJECT #1: ALIEN INVASION

"In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the
bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left
using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game
begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen.
The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens,
a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien
hits the player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses
a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

DEV PHASE 1:
For the first development phase, we’ll make a ship that can move right and left
and fires bullets when the player presses the spacebar. After setting up this
behavior, we can create the aliens and refine the gameplay.
